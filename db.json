He ate good food, drank lots of barley beer, and lost his temper with his wife and children… Marpa did not try to become a special or different kind of person, but simply used his ordinariness as a path, and as such it became the expression of the ground and and fruition of his realization of mahamudra.” (from the book’s introduction).
