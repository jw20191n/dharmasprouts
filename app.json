    "Notes": "This app is about meditation, not only in the sense of relaxing and feeling good, but training one's mind. It can be transformed so that one is able to cultivate basic human qualities such as benevolence, compassion, inner peace and inner strength. This way one's actions to benefit others, be a better person in society, care more for future generation are increased. The app offers in-app purchases, monthly or yearly plan, and some free contents for ages from 4 yo, and it takes us to basics of mind training, how to settle our mind, how to refine our attention, having more stable, clear, and calm mind. Specially one is able to develop an altruistic love, which is the best way to have a happy life and contribute to the happiness of others. Guided meditation, audios, contemplative aspects of arts created by Alan Wallace, Charles Hastings, Dominique Butet, Marie-Christine Champeaux-Cunin, Maria João Pires and Matthieu Ricard, are combined to encourage us to change the world from us. After reaching a big mass, it can change culture and institution eventually; there's no other way of changing society.",
